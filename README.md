# Neural Networks for Automatic Music Composition #
This repository implements several approaches to AMC using neural networks.

# Content #
  * `generate.py` contains functions to generate music
  * `convert.py` contains functions to convert data between formats
  * `processing.py` contains functions to process data for the 2-layer LSTM neural network model
  * `settings.py` contains settings for processing musical data
  * `prepare/` package contains all modules for processing and preparing data for neural networks (work in progress)
  * `models/` package contains neural network models definition

# Remark #
I am working on models and data processing and will release as well as new code, a Jupyter notebook to try out music generation for yourself.
